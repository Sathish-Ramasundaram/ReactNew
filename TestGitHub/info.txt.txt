Add Local Folder to Existing GitHub Repo

1. Clone the GitHub Repo to Your System
bash
git clone https://github.com/Sathish-Ramasundaram/ReactNew.git


Copy Your Local Folder (e.g., TestGithub) Into the Cloned Repo
Place it inside the ReactNew folder:
Code
ReactNew/TestGithub/

3. Open the ReactNew Folder in VS Code

4. Add a File Inside TestGithub
Even a simple info.txt or README.md works to make it trackable.

5. Stage, Commit, and Push
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added TestGithub folder"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
âœ… Your folder is now part of the GitHub repo and visible online.
